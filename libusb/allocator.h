/** \ingroup alloc
 *
 * The type of a user-provided allocation function. This one function acts as
 * a replacement for malloc, calloc, realloc and free, as well as taking
 * additional arguments indicating the file, line and function in which the
 * memory request originated, plus a timestamp and an arbitrary label. These
 * additional arguments are intended to aid in debugging and the allocation
 * function is free to use or ignore them as it wishes.
 *
 * \param[in] pool a user-defined memory pool or other allocation context
 * \param[in] label arbitrary label (often a type name) of this memory
 * \param[in] file file name in which allocation request originated
 * \param[in] func function name in which allocation request originated
 * \param[in] line line number in file from which allocation request originated
 * \param[in] stamp timestamp (seconds) since libusbx context was initialized.
 * \param[in] mem existing memory to resize or free (or NULL)
 * \param[in] head size of header to allocate
 * \param[in] count number of contiguous memory units to allocate after header
 * \param[in] size size of each memory unit to allocate after header
 * \returns pointer to newly allocated/realloced memory, or NULL on failure or
 *            as a result of a (successful) free operation.
 *
 * The most complex memory arrangement that this routine supports managing as
 * a single call is one where a memory region has a header of fixed size,
 * followed by a variable-sized area of one-or-more repeating units. This
 * memory format is relatively common in C code, where a programmer may wish
 * to allocate a fixed structure plus a private data area, or may wish to have
 * a structure followed by a variable-length array.
 *
 * To allow for succinct expression of these memory layouts, as well as to
 * enable user-provided allocators to perform more informed error checking,
 * there are three input parameters for describing the size of the memory
 * region being manipulated: hdr, count and size. The total size of the memory
 * area being manipulated is:
 *
 *     total = head + count * size
 *
 * Naturally the author of an allocator is free to ignore these subtleties and
 * simply record and manipulate the total size of a region.
 * 
 * The allocate function provided by an allocator author must provide several
 * features. In general, these are the features provided by the standard GCC
 * implementation of realloc:
 *
 * - Allocation:
 *
 *       If the request size is zero and input mem pointer is NULL, then a
 *       null operation is requested. The function should do no memory
 *       management, and should return NULL.
 *
 *       If the request size is non-zero and the input mem pointer is NULL,
 *       then the function should allocate a new memory area of at least size
 *       bytes, and return a pointer to it on success, or a NULL on
 *       failure. The memory area returned need not be initialized.
 *
 * - Reallocation:
 *
 *       If the request size is non-zero and the input mem pointer is
 *       non-null, then a memory reallocation/resize operation is
 *       requested. The given memory area can either be resized in-place to
 *       the newly requested size, or a new memory area of the requested size
 *       can be allocated, the old memory copied into the new area as well as
 *       fits, and the old memory area freed. In either case, a pointer to the
 *       resized area should be returned on success or NULL on failure. If
 *       returning NULL, the old memory area must be left valid for further
 *       use.
 *
 *       Note that if the memory area has been reduced in size, then data
 *       should be missing from the end of the area. Similarly, if the memory
 *       area has increased in size then new uninitialized memory will exist
 *       at the end of the area.
 *
 * - Freeing:
 *
 *	 If the request size is zero and the mem pointer is non-null then a
 *	 memory free operation is requested. The pointed-to memory should be
 *	 freed and returned to the memory pool. NULL should be returned on
 *	 success. This allows for convenient uses like:
 *
 *	 > foo.ptr = allocator_free(foo.ptr);
 *
 *	 to invalidate a pointer while freeing the memory it points to.

/** \ingroup alloc
 *
 * The type of a user-provided memory visitation function. A function of this
 * type may be passed to a memory allocator and (if the walk function was
 * defined) the function will be called on each currently allocated memory
 * region, with as many informational parameters filled out as is possible.
 *
 * The memory visitation function may perform whatever operation it wishes,
 * although if it does anything to modify the memory pool that it is visiting,
 * the results are undefined. Typical uses of the visitation function are to
 * determine the amount of memory allocated by a pool, or to print a list of
 * all un-freed memory blocks at some point in the program.
 *
 * The walkinfo pointer that is passed to the walk function will be passed in
 * as the walkinfo for the first invocation of the visit function. Subsequent
 * calls to the visit function will be passed in the return result of the
 * previous visitation call as its walkinfo. The final output of the walk
 * function will be the return result of the final call to the visitation
 * function. This allows for data to be accumulated and passed on during the
 * operation of the visitation function.
 *
 * \param[in] walkinfo the previous output of the last call to this function.

 * \param[in] line line number in file from which allocation request originated

 * \param[in] size size of a memory unit in this allocated block
 * \param[in] count number of contiguous memory units allocated in this block
 * \returns an arbitrary pointer that will be passed into the next call of
